    <p>
      INCOLN in caricature is a phase of the career of the great war President
      that has thus far lacked adequate treatment. Yet he was the most bitterly
      assailed and savagely cartooned public man of his time, and one has only
      to search the newspapers and periodicals of that period to find striking
      confirmation of this fact. The attitude of Great Britain toward the Union
      and its President was then one of cynical and scarcely veiled hostility,
      and nowhere were the sentiments of the English government and of the
      English masses more faithfully reflected than in the cartoons which
      appeared in London <i>Punch</i> between 1861 and 1865, many of which had
      Lincoln for their central figure. He was also frequently cartooned in <i>Vanity
      Fair</i> the American counterpart of <i>Punch</i>; in <i>Frank Leslie's
      Illustrated Newspaper</i>, and in <i>Harper's Weekly</i>. Indeed, nowhere
      were the changing sentiments of the people of the North, their likes and
      dislikes, their alternates hopes and fears, their hasty, often unjust
      judgments of men and measures, more vividly reflected than in the cartoons
      dealing with Lincoln which appeared in the last named journal during the
      epoch-making days of his Presidency. Thus the thirty-two plates from these
      sources here brought together have a value and interest already important
      and sure to increase with the passage of time, for they reflect with
      unconscious vividness, and as nothing else can do, the life and color of
      an historic era, and how his fellows regarded the grandest figure of that
      era. It is with their value as human documents in mind that they have been
      rescued from their half-forgotten hiding places, and assembled in
      chronological sequence, with such comment as may be necessary to make
      their purpose and meaning clear to older men, whose memory may have grown
      dim, as well as to the new generation that has come upon the stage in the
      eight and thirty years that have elapsed since the close of the Civil War.

    </h4>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">P</span>late Number One&mdash;This
      cartoon, "Lincoln Ã  la Blondin," which appeared in <i>Harper's Weekly</i>,
      on August 25, 1860, seems to have been suggested by Blondin's crossing of
      Niagara on a tight rope with a man on his back&mdash;an event then fresh
      in the public mind. It also recalls an interesting phase of Lincoln's
      first campaign for the Presidency, which had its origin in a
      characteristic incident of the candidate's earlier years. It was in March,
      1830, that Lincoln, at that time a youth of twenty-one, removed with his
      father and family from Indiana to Illinois, locating on the bluffs of the
      Sangamon River about ten miles from Decatur. There he and his kinsman,
      John Hanks, built a hewed log house, and broke fifteen acres of prairie
      sod with the two yoke of oxen they had driven from Indiana. They then
      felled the trees, cut off the logs, and with mauls and wedges split the
      rails to fence in the land they had broken. The following winter, the
      winter of the "deep snow" as it was known in Illinois, Lincoln alone made
      three thousand rails for a neighbor, walking three miles each day to do
      it. The Republican state convention of Illinois assembled at Decatur on
      May 9, 1860, and the first act of its chairman was to invite Lincoln, who
      was modestly seated in the body of the hall, to a seat upon the platform.
      An eye-witness describes the scene that followed as one of tumultuous
      enthusiasm. No way could be made through the shouting throng, and Lincoln
      was borne bodily, over their heads and shoulders, to the place of honor.
      Quiet restored, the chairman again arose and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is an old Democrat outside who has something he wishes to present
      to this convention."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the door of the hall swung open, and a sturdy old man marched in,
      shouldering two fence-rails, surmounted by a banner inscribed, in large
      letters:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two rails from a lot made by Abraham Lincoln and John Hanks in the
      Sangamon Bottom, in the year 1830."
    </p>
    <p>
      The bearer was John Hanks himself, and he had come to do his part in
      making his old friend President. "It was an historic scene and moment. In
      an instant Lincoln, the rail-splitter, was accepted as the representative
      of the working man and the type and embodiment of the American idea of
      human freedom and possible human elevation. The applause was deafening.
      But it was something more than mere applause," for there was no opposition
      afterwards, to a resolution that declared Lincoln to be the first choice
      of the Republicans of Illinois for President, and instructed the delegates
      to the national convention to cast the vote of the State as a unit for
      him. It is a part of history how the tidal wave of enthusiasm behind this
      resolution swept from Decatur to Chicago, and thence over the country.

      cartoon, "The Inside Track," published in <i>Vanity Fair</i>, on March 2,
      1861, has for its motive the popular doubt and incertitude attending the
      make-up of the Cabinet and the policy of the new Administration toward the
      South. The President-elect is shown, with a doubtful expression on his
      face, flanked on either side by Thurlow Weed, who is drawn to represent a
      western river gambler of the period, and William H. Seward, while Horace
      Greeley, their sworn political foe, thrusts his head through the door in
      time to hear Weed remark impressively: "Trust to my friend Seward&mdash;trust
      to us. We'll compromise this little difficulty for you. But trust to us.
      Gentlemen from the country are often swindled by unprincipled sharpers.
      Trust to us." Seward, as we know, became Lincoln's Secretary of State, and
      Weed one of his trusted advisers, while the editor of the <i>Tribune</i>
      remained until the end a thorn in the side of the President.

      March 9, 1861, holds up to ridicule Lincoln's memorable secret journey
      from Harrisburg to Washington, but its point-of-view is a mistaken one.
      Lincoln's advisers had good grounds for believing that there existed a
      plot to murder him during his passage through Baltimore, and every
      consideration forbade needless risk. The trip across Maryland was,
      therefore, made suddenly and in private, but there was no attempt at
      personal disguise, as the cartoon infers, nor any undignified concealment
      on the part of Lincoln or the friends who accompanied him.

      Welles, whose course as Secretary of the Navy was then the cause of much
      ill-natured comment. We had no navy when the war began, and Welles had to
      create one. His way of doing it provoked much opposition, but he had
      always the confidence of the President, and so good a judge as the late
      Charles A. Dana has told us that though "there was no noise in the street
      when he went along, he was a wise, strong man, who understood his duty,
      and who was patient, laborious and intelligent at his task." The generous
      growth of hair which the artist has given Welles was not his own. Instead
      he wore a wig, which was parted in the middle, the hair falling down on
      each side, and it was, perhaps, from his peculiar appearance that the idea
      originated that he was old-fashioned in his methods.

      Thirteen&mdash;This cartoon, "The Overdue Bill," published in <i>Punch</i>,
      on September 27, 1862, has for its motive the Union's crying need of men
      and money. The President is shown seated at a desk, with hands, as usual,
      thrust into his pockets, glancing discomfitedly at a paper inscribed "I
      promise to subdue the South in ninety days&mdash;A. Lincoln," held out to
      him by a Confederate soldier, who says "Your ninety days' promissory note
      isn't taken up yet, sirree!" It would have been more fitting to have made
      Seward the central figure in this cartoon, for it was Lincoln's Secretary
      of State, and not the President himself, who was loudest in proclaiming
      that the war would end in three months. It is worth recording that Seward
      when questioned in after years by a friend as to the reasons which
      prompted this famous prediction of his, at first declined to give an
      answer, but finally said that he believed at the time that if the South
      did not give in within ninety days the North would.

      Fair</i>, on October 4, 1862, heralds the forthcoming Emancipation
      Proclamation, the President being pictured as a vagrom bird-peddler, whom
      an absence of customers impels to the remark: "Darn these here
      black-birds. If nobody won't buy'em I'll have to open the cages and let'em
      fly." This design recalls an historic Cabinet meeting held on the Saturday
      following the battle of Antietam, which cut short Lee's invasion of the
      North and compelled him to recross the Potomac. The members of the Cabinet
      were summoned, on this occasion, not to give advice but to hear a
      decision. The President told them that the hour for delay had passed, and
      that the time had come to make the emancipation of the slaves the declared
      policy of the Administration. Public sentiment would now sustain it. A
      strong and outspoken popular voice demanded it, and the demand came from
      the best friends of the government. "And I have promised my God that I
      would do it," added the President, reverently and in a low voice. "Did I
      understand you correctly, Mr. President?" asked Secretary Chase, who had
      heard but indistinctly the low-voiced utterance. "I made a solemn vow,
      before God," was the answer, "that if General Lee should be driven back
      from Pennsylvania, I would crown the result by the declaration of freedom
      to the slaves." And he did.

      Seventeen&mdash;This cartoon, without title, published in <i>Harper's
      Weekly</i>, on January 3, 1863, was prompted by the fearful Union
      slaughter at Fredericksburg. Columbia confronts the President and demands
      an accounting for the thousands slain in that conflict. "This reminds me
      of a little joke," Lincoln is made to say. "Go," is the angry rejoinder,
      "tell your joke at Springfield." Which calls to mind a story told the
      writer by the late Governor Curtin of Pennsylvania. It was after the
      battle of Fredericksburg, and Governor Curtin had gone to the front to
      look after his State's dead and wounded in person. While thus engaged he
      received a telegram from Lincoln bidding him come to Washington. He
      responded at once, and reaching the White House late in the evening found
      that the President had retired. Seated by the latter's bedside, he told
      what he had seen. "It was not a battle," said he; "it was, a slaughter.
      Many of the wounded have received no attention, and thousands of the dead
      are still unburied. From the bottom of my heart, Mr. President, I wish we
      could find some way of ending this war."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lincoln listened patiently, but with manifest anxiety, to the Governor's
      statement. When it was finished, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Curtin, it's a big job we've got on hand. It reminds me of what once
      happened to the son of a friend of mine out in Illinois. There was an
      apple-tree in the old man's orchard of which he was especially choice, and
      one day in the fall his two boys, John and Jim, went out to gather the
      apples from this tree. John climbed the tree to shake the fruit off, while
      Jim remained below to gather it as it fell. There was a boar grubbing in
      the orchard, and seeing what was going on, it waddled up to the tree and
      began to eat the falling apples faster than Jim could gather them from the
      ground. This roiled Jim, and catching the boar by the tail he pulled
      vigorously, whereat the latter, with an angry squeal, began to snap at his
      legs. Afraid to let go, Jim held on for dear life, until finally, growing
      weary, he called to his brother to help him. John, from the top of the
      tree, asked what was wanted.'I want you,' said Jim, between the rushes of
      the boar,'to come down here and help me to let go of this darned hog's
      tail.' And Curtin," added the President, "that's just what I want of you
      and the rest: I want you to pitch in and help me let go of the hog's tail
      I have got hold of."
    </p>
    <p>
      Before beginning this story Lincoln had been deeply depressed. When it was
      finished he laughed as heartily as did his auditor, and seemed instantly
      to recover his wonted spirits. "Pardon me, Mr. President," said the
      Governor, prompted by this change of mood, "but is not this story-telling
      habit of yours a sort of safety valve for you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have hit it, Curtin," was the quick reply. "If I could not tell these
      stories I think I should die."

      hands in the foreground of an impressive picture of rapine and desolation.
      The result sought by the artist is made clear in the appended dialogue:

    </p>
    <p>

      Whilst my brave myrmidons enjoy his pangs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Polish insurrection, then in progress, furnishes the motive of this
      cartoon, which serves to recall the good will shown by Russia for the
      Union, when it stood without other friends among the nations. How
      substantial was this good will furnishes the cue to a chapter in our
      history which yet remains to be written. A part of this chapter the writer
      once had from the lips of the late Simon Cameron, of Pennsylvania. Just
      before General Cameron went to Russia as American Minister in the early
      part of 1862 he was charged with a secret commission. He was directed,
      upon the presentation of his letters to the Russian Chancellor in St.
      Petersburg, to say that President Lincoln asked that the Minister might
      have a personal and confidential interview with the Czar. If this was
      accorded he should say to the Czar that the President was troubled about
      the possibility of interference by England or France in behalf of the
      Confederacy, and that if the friendship of Russia was such as to justify
      the monarch in conveying, confidentially, any intimation of his feelings
      and attitude in such a contingency, the President would be grateful. The
      interview was accorded, the message was delivered and the answer was
      cordial, and in about these words: "The friendship of Russia for the
      United States has long continued, and is such as to justify the
      President's request. The reply of Russia is ready. You will convey to Mr.
      Lincoln my personal regards, and say that the danger of interference by
      any European nation is exceedingly remote; but in that improbable
      contingency, or upon the appearance of real danger of it, the friendship
      of Russia for the United States will be made known in a decisive manner,
      which no other nation will be able to mistake."
    </p>
    <p>
      This message was duly reported to the President. How the Czar kept his
      promise came out in an interview which he granted in 1879 to Wharton
      Barker, for many years Russian financial agent in America. He said to
      Barker: "In the autumn of 1862 France and England proposed to Russia in
      formal (but not in official) way, the joint recognition by European
      nations of the independence of the Confederate States. My immediate answer
      was:'I will not cooperate in such action, and I will not acquiesce; but,
      on the contrary, I shall accept recognition of the independence of the
      Confederate States as a <i>casus belli</i> for Russia, and that the
      governments of France and England may understand that this is no idle
      threat, I will send a Pacific fleet to San Francisco and an Atlantic fleet
      to New York.' Sealed orders were given to both admirals. My fleets arrived
      at the American ports, there was no recognition of the independence of the
      Confederate States by England and France, the American rebellion was put
      down and the great American republic continues. All this I did because of
      love for my own dear Russia. I acted thus because I understood that Russia
      would have a more serious task to perform if the American republic, with
      advanced industrial development, was broken up and England left in control
      of most branches of modern industrial development."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was England's warm resentment of Russia's attitude that prompted the
      cartoon under consideration. Even more pronounced in its mocking cynicism
      was <i>Punch's</i> cartoon for November 7, 1863. The tacit alliance
      between Russia and the United States still grated upon English
      sensibilities, and the artist provoked the multitude to laughter by
      depicting the President as Mephistopheles saluting the Russian bear. Hard
      things in plenty were said of Lincoln, both at home and abroad, but this
      is the only instance in which he was portrayed in Satan's livery. British
      malice could go no further than this.

      policy in regard to slavery, and another element, which, while supporting
      the Union, believed that slavery should be let alone; but it shrank into
      insignificance as time went on, and when the Republican Convention met at
      Baltimore on June 7, Lincoln was renominated on the first ballot. The
      Democratic National Convention was held twelve weeks later in Chicago. A
      few days before it met President Lincoln said to a friend: "They must
      nominate a peace Democrat on a war platform, or a war Democrat on a peace
      platform." The convention chose the second of these alternatives. It
      adopted a platform which declared the war a failure and demanded an
      immediate cessation of hostilities, and it nominated for President the
      best known of all the war Democrats, General George B. McClellan. The
      latter's chances of election, whatever they may have been, disappeared
      within a fortnight of his nomination. The course of the war during the
      summer had been studded thickly with bloody and seemingly indecisive
      battles. Both in the East and the West the opposing armies were grinding
      in almost continuous struggle. But Sherman's capture of Atlanta and
      Farra-gut's entrance into Mobile harbor, proved to the people of the North
      that the end was in sight, and when the President called for five hundred
      thousand more men they came forward rapidly, a large and valuable
      percentage of them being volunteers who had served their time under
      previous enlistments. Long before election day it was evident that no
      prospect remained of Democratic success. When the polls were closed and
      the votes counted, Lincoln's enormous popular majority of more than
      400,000 fairly buried the McClellan electoral tickets. Kentucky and
      Delaware, with New Jersey, testified their disgust with Emancipation, but
      they were of small account in an electoral college of 233 votes, wherein
      212 were solidly against them.

      in the light of after events, a touch of humor not intended by the artist.
      When it was drawn, the belief was generally prevalent in England that
      Lincoln's defeat at the coming election was a foregone conclusion. Thus,
      this cartoon pictures Lincoln and Davis bound to adjacent benches by
      ropes, significantly labelled "Debts," but it was still wet from the press
      when Lincoln, as we have just seen, was re-elected by the largest majority
      in the electoral college ever given to a candidate.

      a cartoon published in <i>Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper</i> on

      places the President, with legs drawn up, on the bed of the Confederate
      leader. "Is that you still there, Long Abe?" asks the suddenly awakened
      man. "Yes, and I am going to be four years longer," is the reply.

      on December 3, 1864. Its character is explained in its title, and it shows
      one of those fabled birds, on which the artist has placed the head of
      Lincoln, rising from a pyre, the fuel for which is furnished by commerce,
      credit, the Constitution, a free press, habeas corpus and State rights.
      How it impressed the public for whom it was intended can only be
      conjectured, but to the eyes of an American, a generation after the death
      of the man whom it thus held up to condemnation, it seems as brutal in
      motive as it is misleading in fact.

      represents Lincoln remonstrating with the American eagle in the dress of
      Uncle Sam over the Senate's proposed abrogation of Canadian treaties.
      "Now, Uncle Sam," the President is reported as saying, "you're in a darned
      hurry to serve this notice on John Bull. Now, it's my duty as your
      attorney, to tell you that you may drive him to go over to that cuss,
      Davis." But John Bull was not to be driven "over to that cuss, Davis." Two
      months later the war was ended, and Lincoln dead. <i>Punch</i> has

      lately made his last visit to the front, was represented, with a drumhead
      for a table, writing from City Point, Virginia: "All seems well with us."
      These words, in the light of after events, are not without a touch of
      pathos. When the journal in which they appeared reached its readers,

      published in <i>Punch</i>, on May 6,1865, testifies to the world-wide
      grief which attended the death of the great war President, and shows how
      strong had become his hold upon all men who love brave deeds and honest
      lives. Britons had not hesitated to criticise and upbraid him living, but
      dead they were quick to recognize him as the noblest, knightliest figure
      of an age rich above all things else in the number and grandeur of its
      great men.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been impossible to trace the authorship of most of the cartoons
      herewith reproduced from <i>Harper s Weekly</i> and <i>Frank Leslie's
      Illustrated Newspaper</i>, but three of them, at least, are known to be
      from the pencil of the elder Frank Bellew, an English artist who came to
      this country to embark with John Brougham in the publication of a
      short-lived weekly, called the <i>Lantern</i>, later helping to found half
      a dozen other periodicals. Bellew had cleverness and versatility, and a
      rich vein of humor, as the drawings "Sinbad Lincoln and the Old Man of the
      Sea," "Lincoln's Last Warning" and "Long Abraham a Little Longer" bear
      witness, but he failed to achieve complete success in his work, and left
      no impress upon the political thought of his time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The designer of a majority of the cartoons reproduced from <i>Vanity Fair</i>,
      which, between 1859 and 1863, ran a checkered but lively existence, was
      the late Henry Louis Stephens, a man of fertile and incisive wit, with
      unusual ability to enforce a pictorial moral by simple yet telling
      methods. For a brief period Mr. Stephens's attitude toward Lincoln seems
      to have been touched by the not always good-natured suspicion with which
      the public regards a new and comparatively untried man; but no sooner had
      Sumter been fired upon than the artist and his journal became ardent and
      unswerving in their support of the Union, and so continued until the end.
      Stephens's drawings, though somewhat crude and faulty in method, are,
      nevertheless, notable for their originality and force. He lacked, however,
      either the inclination or the opportunity to continue in the field for
      which he had shown so marked an aptitude, and long before his death, in
      1883, fallen into obscurity.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of the cartoons reproduced from London <i>Punch</i> are from the
      pencil of Sir John Tenniel, who, in 1901, concluded half a century of
      brilliant service on that journal. Tenniel was already an artist of repute
      when he joined the staff of <i>Punch</i> in 1851, and for many years
      preceding his self-sought retirement he was recognized as incomparably the
      greatest caricaturist of his time&mdash;his pencil a force to be taken
      into account by sagacious statesmen in every forecast of the drift of
      public opinion. His range is not a wide one, yet within its clearly
      defined limits he is nearly always powerful. Although his methods are
      usually simple, through them he secures signal breadth and strength, while
      now and then he gives an impression of power such as one fancies an Angelo
      might have given had he amused himself by drawings reflecting upon the
      politics of his time. If there was any doubt in official minds respecting
      the necessity of sending an army to the rescue of Khartoum, it vanished
      when Tenniel drew his picture of General Gordon standing behind an
      earthwork and looking across the desert for a glimpse of the expected
      redcoats. That touched the heart of England, and was more potent than the
      fiercest denunciation from the Opposition bench of the Gladstone
      ministry's inaction in the Soudan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tenniel is first of all a satirist, but he has seldom been either unjust
      or unfair in his work. His longest and most memorable departure from
      fairness was when, in common with the ruling class of England generally,
      he misinterpreted our Civil War and caricatured the chief actor therein
      with astonishing perversity. Still, he was not more frequently or more
      deeply in the wrong than some of our own politicians, who could not plead
      his excuse of distance from the scene, and, to his credit, be it said,
      when once convinced of his error he made prompt and generous amends
      therefor. Nothing could have been more fitting nor finer in its way than
      his design, already referred to, which showed Britannia laying a wreath on
      the bier of the martyred President and which was accompanied by these
      appreciative lines from the pen of Tom Taylor:

      <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      How humble yet how hopeful he could be;
    </p>
    <p>
      How in good fortune and in ill the same;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor bitter in success nor boastful he,
    </p>
    <p>
      Thirsty for gold, nor feverish for fame.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He went about his work, such work as few
    </p>
    <p>
      Ever had laid on head and heart and hand,

    <p>
      As one who knows where there's a task to do,

    <p>
      As in his peasant boyhood he had plied

    <p>

    <p>
      Rough culture, but such trees large fruit may bear,

    <p>
      If but their stocks be of right girth and grain.
